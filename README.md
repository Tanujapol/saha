This is the project which helps poor people and innocent street animals to fill their stomachs.
In this project we have developed a semi functional web application through which the extra wasted food is collected and given to the needy through NGO's.
The main file in the above is "P1.py"
All other files are used to enhance the design of the web application!
We have developed the whole backend and frontend in the above project using the Python(TKINTER module).
