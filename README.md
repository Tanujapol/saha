ZERO HUNGER â€“ SAHA is a socially driven project developed during the GDSC Hackathon with the aim of minimizing food waste and supporting both underprivileged communities and stray animals. Aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goal: Zero Hunger, the app connects food donors with NGOs and volunteers to ensure excess food reaches those in need. Built under tight deadlines, the project reflects our passion for tech-based social impact and our commitment to responsible innovation.

This is the project which helps poor people and innocent street animals to fill their stomachs.
In this project we have developed a semi functional web application through which the extra wasted food is collected and given to the needy through NGO's.
The main file in the above is "P1.py"
All other files are used to enhance the design of the web application!
We have developed the whole backend and frontend in the above project using the Python(TKINTER module).
